# dbSNP GRCh37 VCF Setup

**Date:** 2025-06-23
**Author:** Austin Esparza

This document outlines the setup process for acquiring dbSNP variant data for the GRCh37 build and intersecting it with risk gene regions. The focus is on reproducibility, efficient CLI tooling, and preparing downstream-ready filtered variant datasets.

## Directory Setup

```bash
cd ~/Downloads/JonesLab
mkdir -p dbsnp
cd dbsnp
```

## Toolchain Installation (macOS M1/ARM)

Install Homebrew and essential tools:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
echo 'eval "$\(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zprofile
echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zprofile
source ~/.zshrc
brew install wget bcftools
```

## File Acquisition (dbSNP GRCh37 VCF)

Download the dbSNP release VCF and index from NCBI:

```bash
wget --show-progress \
  https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/redesign/latest_release/VCF/GCF_000001405.25.gz \
  https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/redesign/latest_release/VCF/GCF_000001405.25.gz.tbi
```

## Merging Gene Regions to BED

Ensure you have a merged BED file of risk gene regions with gene labels:

```bash
output_merged="/Users/austinesparza/Downloads/JonesLab/BED/merged_genes_tagged.BED"
temp_file=$(mktemp)
for i in "${!genes[@]}"; do
  gene="${genes[$i]}"
  bed="${beds[$i]}"
  awk -v gene="$gene" 'BEGIN{OFS="\t"} {print $1, $2, $3, gene}' "$bed" >> "$temp_file"
done
sort -k1,1 -k2,2n "$temp_file" > "$output_merged"
rm "$temp_file"
echo "Merged BED created at: $output_merged"
```

## Intersect dbSNP with Risk Gene Regions

```bash
bcftools view \
  -R /Users/austinesparza/Downloads/JonesLab/BED/merged_genes_tagged.BED \
  GCF_000001405.25.gz \
  -Oz -o dbsnp_in_risk_genes.vcf.gz
```

## Index the Result

```bash
bcftools index dbsnp_in_risk_genes.vcf.gz
```

## Sanity Check

```bash
bcftools view dbsnp_in_risk_genes.vcf.gz | head -n 10
```

## Summary

* Successfully installed Homebrew, wget, and bcftools.
* Downloaded dbSNP GRCh37 VCF and index (26 GB).
* Merged gene-specific BED files into a unified and sorted BED.
* Extracted all SNPs overlapping risk gene regions using bcftools.
* Generated an indexed, filtered VCF (dbsnp\_in\_risk\_genes.vcf.gz) for use in downstream variant interpretation and enrichment analyses.
