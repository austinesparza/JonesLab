# Structural Variant Annotation & Gene Panel Reference

## Project Overview
This repository supports ongoing structural variant (SV) annotation and gene panel benchmarking work within a germline ovarian cancer discovery context. The primary objective is to ensure robust annotation of SVs and copy number variants (CNVs) within key ovarian cancer susceptibility genes using GRCh37 reference coordinates.

This repository is maintained as part of the author's training under the U-GROW Summer Institute and is affiliated with the Jones Lab at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. This repository contains **no protected health information** or internal datasets.

## Scope and Objectives
- Extract full-transcript, longest-isoform genomic coordinates for high-priority genes.
- Annotate structural variant calls from anonymized cohort VCFs.
- Curate pathway and function metadata for known EOC risk genes.
- Support gene-based CNV enrichment analysis using public genomic tools and references.

## Genes of Interest (GRCh37 Coordinates)
A core gene panel was selected based on established literature and includes key DNA repair and checkpoint response genes. Coordinates are derived from GENCODE v19 (longest transcript).
