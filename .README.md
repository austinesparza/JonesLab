## Project Summary

This repository supports a research training project focused on identifying rare germline variants in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) susceptibility genes. The project emphasizes reproducible workflows for filtering, annotating, and harmonizing pathogenic variants, particularly SNPs, indels, and structural variants (SVs), using GRCh37-based reference data.

The project has two integrated goals:

1. **Harmonize pathogenic SNPs and indels** from public databases (ClinVar, dbSNP) within defined ovarian cancer risk gene regions, and assess which of these are represented on genotyping arrays.  
2. **Extract and annotate gene-spanning structural variants** to better understand their overlap with coding and regulatory regions of known EOC risk genes.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the discovery and interpretation of genetic risk variants, from familial studies to GWAS.
- Gain exposure to sequencing platform modalities (array, short-read WGS, long-read WGS).
- Develop bioinformatics proficiency in `bcftools`, `bedtools`, `R`, and command-line tools.
- Learn how pathogenicity is defined across variant types and platforms.
- Investigate the clinical challenges of EOC, including the problem of "missing heritability."
- Navigate public variant databases (e.g., UCSC Genome Browser, gnomAD SVs) to identify disease-relevant features.

## Project Tasks

### Part 1: SNP/Indel Harmonization and Genotyping Array Intersection
- Extract gene regions of interest (GRCh37 coordinates) using GENCODE annotations.
- Subset ClinVar and dbSNP files to these regions.
- Normalize and match variants by chromosome, position, reference, and alternate allele.
- Retain entries labeled "Pathogenic" in ClinVar.
- Intersect with external genotyping array site lists to identify pathogenic variants captured by arrays.

### Part 2: Structural Variant (SV) Annotation
- Annotate deletions and duplications overlapping target gene regions.
- Identify which exons, UTRs, or intronic regions are affected.
- Create tables summarizing gene-region impacts for downstream variant interpretation efforts.
